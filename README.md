# Review-paper-about-cryptography
In this document, we provide a review of the purposes of cryptography, the evolution of the cryptography in the recent past to extent of it today, and the future development of the cryptography. Cryptography started with a list of challenges for protecting data, information, continues with the presentation of the basic cryptographic algorithms and protocols. From a technical point of view, cryptography is the most important solution for many of the security challenges that are present on the internet. So it is clear that the technology of cryptography exists to solve most of the problems. But there are several issues that have obstructed the widespread use of cryptography on the internet. Cryptography faces a difficult problem as a science. Most of the algorithms used in cryptography can not be proven secure. For that reason, there is suspicion around many of the algorithms used in cryptography. The next aspect is related to the intellectual property associated with the cryptographic algorithms. Most of the cryptographic algorithms are patented, and only very few companies and institutes have licensed them for use.
